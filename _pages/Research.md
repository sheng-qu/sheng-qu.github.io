## Working Papers

### **"International Students and College Tuition in the U.S."**

**Abstract:**
Tuition costs in the U.S. have risen rapidly over the past two decades. This paper examines how the growth in international student enrollment affects both sticker-price and net-price tuition at U.S. Ph.D.-granting institutions, leveraging China’s WTO accession and changes in U.S. visa policy as natural experiments that led to a substantial increase in Chinese student enrollment. Using institution-level panel data from 2000 to 2019, I employ a shift-share instrumental variable approach and an event-study difference-in-differences design to estimate the effects of rising international enrollment on college tuition. The results show that international enrollment increases out-of-state sticker-price tuition at public universities but reduces it at private institutions. Both public and private institutions lower net-price tuition in response to increased international enrollment, with private institutions making more substantial reductions. These divergent responses highlight differing institutional priorities in how international demand is incorporated into pricing strategies.

### **"College Admission, Mismatch, and Labor Market Outcomes"**

**Abstract:**  
This paper estimates the effects of the Chinese college admission reform on students' labor market outcomes. The reform aimed to reduce the mismatch between student ability and college quality in 26 of China's 34 provinces. Using individual-level data with detailed information on students' labor market behavior, the study finds that the reform had no significant impact on the log of yearly labor income for affected students.
