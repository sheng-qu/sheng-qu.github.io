### **"International Students and College Tuition in the U.S."** (Job Market Paper)

<details>
<summary><strong>Abstract ▼</strong></summary>
<br>
Tuition costs in the U.S. have risen rapidly over the past two decades. This paper examines how the growth in international student enrollment affects both sticker-price and net-price tuition at U.S. Ph.D.-granting institutions. It leverages China’s WTO accession and changes in U.S. visa policy as natural experiments that drove a surge in Chinese student enrollment. Using institution-level panel data from 2000 to 2019, I apply a shift-share instrumental variable approach and an event-study difference-in-differences design to estimate the effects of rising international enrollment on tuition. The results indicate that international enrollment increases out-of-state sticker-price tuition at public universities but reduces it at private institutions. Both sectors lower net-price tuition in response to international demand, with private institutions making more substantial reductions. These divergent responses highlight differing institutional priorities in tuition-setting behavior.

### **"College Admission, Mismatch, and Labor Market Outcomes"**

<details>
<summary><strong>Abstract ▼</strong></summary>
<br>

This paper estimates the effects of China's college admission reform on students' labor market outcomes. The reform, implemented in 26 of 34 provinces, aimed to reduce the mismatch between student ability and college quality. Using individual-level data with detailed labor market information, the study finds that the reform had no significant impact on affected students' log yearly labor income.
