## Working Papers

### **"College Admission, Mismatch, and Labor Market Outcomes"**

**Abstract:**  
This paper estimates the effects of the Chinese college admission reform on students' labor market outcomes. The reform aimed to reduce the mismatch between student ability and college quality in 26 of China's 34 provinces. Using individual-level data with detailed information on students' labor market behavior, the study finds that the reform had no significant impact on the log of yearly labor income for affected students.
