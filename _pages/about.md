## Welcome!

Hello and welcome! My name is Sheng Qu, and I am a PhD candidate in the Economics Department at the University of Colorado Boulder. My research focuses on labor economics, economics of education, and public policy. My current work examines how the rise in international undergraduate enrollment in the U.S. affects the tuition-setting behavior of U.S. higher education institutions.

**I am currently on the job market for the 2025-2026 academic year.**
